pyQPCR
======

This is a command line version of qPCR normalization software qBase (now proprietary). This program transforms raw expression measurements into calibrated relative quantities using a modified delta-delta-Ct method accounting for primer efficiency. The qBase alogrithm can use several normalizer genes and allows for inter-plates calibration.
Original publication describing the method: Hellemans, J. et al. (2007) qBase relative quantification framework and software for management and automated analysis of real-time quantitative PCR data. Genome Biol. 8(2):R19.
